The Pairs_Program has two versions, one implemented in Java and one in C++. 
It was an exercise for the Modern Programming Methods Master's course. 

The program takes as input lines of pairs of numbers in the form X|Y where X and Y are integers.
The output gives again all the lines of the input, added with the with the additional sign [Z|W] where W shows how many times in the input we had the occurence of X, and Z shows the "position" of X. 
For example, for an input such as:

3|78
4|778
3|82
2|78
3|78

we have the output:

3|78[1 of 2]
4|778[1 of 1]
3|82[2 of 2]
2|78[1 of 1]
3|78[1 of 2]

The purpose of the program was to be coded in less than 2000 lines of code each, and to use the Containers of each language. Each program should also have a complexity less than nlogn. 
My implementations have complexity O(n), which means that they accept a very large number of lines as input.
